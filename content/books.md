### Reading Philosophy:

*TLDR: This section deserves a separate post. Feel free to skip to the list.*



Books are for learning, not completion. I love [naval's](https://twitter.com/naval) approach to books. 

>    **Learn and understand > Completion** 

Technology has massively improved the sources of learning. Youtube, MOOCs, blog articles, visualizations, memes, etc... 

>    **Youtube/Online Courses = Best teachers + Visualizations (for eyes) + Audio (ears) + delayed feedback (active discord/reddit communities solve this)**
>
>    **Books = Best teachers + high information density + decoding + imagination overhead + better control**
>
>    **Physical Classroom = Teachers (quality depends) + Visualizations (for eyes) + Audio (ears) + quick feedback**


The point is technology is magnifying the learning bandwidth. Each method has its pros/cons, but things are definitely moving online. 

What has this to do with books?
Well, to me, books represent mini-worlds - databases of intelligently structured information where the ToC is the map. If you know how to navigate them and know what you are looking, they become powerful. Books serve as a symbol (memory cue) to concepts.
