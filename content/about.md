Writing 'About me' is hard. You should give it a try (No, really, go start a blog and write an about me page). I love **gwern's** [about page](https://www.gwern.net/Links) and will redesign mine with similar sophistication going forward. That said, here's a compressed version.

#### Background -

> Currently lost in and navigating the **crypto/blockchain** rabbit hole.
>
> Previous Life - **Engineer & Cofounder** at [**Cognirel**](http://cognirel.com/) ([acquired](https://www.techinasia.com/dailyhunts-parent-firm-acquires-cognirel-technologies-ai-lab) by Dailyhunt)
>
> **Software Engineer** at Flipkart
>
> Bachelor's **Computer Science**(18') from **BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus**


#### About the blog -

Most articles will be around topics listed below. The bold ones carry more weight. [This page](/posts/why/) lists the purpose of this blog. I will soon include a 'principles' page.
