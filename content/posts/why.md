Common reasons to blog - [kauri](https://kauri.io/#communities/Documentation%20and%20technical%20communication/why-do-people-write/)
 and [shoutmeloud](https://www.shoutmeloud.com/top-10-reasons-why-people-blog.html#8_To_connect_with_like-minded_people)


While all the reasons mentioned are valid, some resonate more with me:

1. [**Signalling**](https://jasoncollins.blog/please-not-another-bias-an-evolutionary-take-on-behavioural-economics/)  (hey, but I am aware!)

2. **Accountability** 

    Doing things in the open means an extra BS filter + feedback (do reach out for that).

3. **Learn**
 
    > *"If you want to learn something, read about it. If you want to understand something, write about it. If you want to master something, teach it."*
    >
    > â€” <cite>Yogi Bhajan</cite>

4. **I like writing** - to ideate, explore, and design information structure.

5. **Automated Similarity Search**

    Blogs are like a torch in [the dark forest](https://g.co/kgs/JEa3sY). A search for one's own tribe. Do reach out if you find anything interesting and wanna talk.
    
6. **Forming a World-view**

    Everyone is an investor (with time and money) and crypto is making it more explicit. Sound judgement is a useful skill to have (from [naval's](https://twitter.com/naval) tweets).
